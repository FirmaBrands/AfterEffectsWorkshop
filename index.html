Create a website for me that will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
The goal: I am going to run an After Effects workshop for the company I work at, and I want users to vote on which topics interest them the most. Users should be able to add topics to the list and vote on other topics. The aim is to prioritize, so it would be great if we could create a list where users can rank what they want the most versus the least. Also users should be able to put links to refrences of stuff they want to make (which are clickable). it should be responsive on both web and mobile. after deveoping the base suggest features.  here is my firebase embed:
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyC6gjDkHHsh9ru3PFHJVJAZpGIvQWja96o",
  authDomain: "aftereffectsworkshop-ab75f.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "aftereffectsworkshop-ab75f",
  storageBucket: "aftereffectsworkshop-ab75f.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "522266658938",
  appId: "1:522266658938:web:f4531315cc8e7c8cc413c3"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
